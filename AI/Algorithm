1. Gather data: The first step is to gather data that will be used to train your model.
                You will need historical market data, such as stock prices, exchange rates,
                or commodities prices, depending on what you want to trade.
                a. you can use data from RobinHood, yahoo, binance, coinbase, and alpha vantage. make sure to compare
                   the data from different sources to make sure they are consistent. This will help the predictor make
                   better predictions.

2. Clean and preprocess the data: Once you have the data, you will need to clean it and preprocess
                                  it so that it can be used for training. This may involve removing outliers,
                                  filling in missing values, and normalizing the data.

3. Define the model architecture: You will need to define the architecture of your deep learning model.
                                  This will involve deciding on the number of layers, the types of layers
                                  (e.g., convolutional, recurrent), and the activation functions to use.

4. Train the model: After defining the architecture, you will need to train your model using your preprocessed data.
                    This may involve using techniques such as backpropagation and gradient descent.

5. Test the model: Once the model has been trained, you will need to test it to see how well it performs on new,
                   unseen data. You may need to adjust the model parameters and architecture to improve performance.

6. Integrate the model into a trading bot: Finally, you will need to integrate your model into a trading bot that can
                                           automatically make trades based on the signals generated by the model.
