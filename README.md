# Trading-models

This project is to train different deep learning models to achieve better predictions. 
It will also include NLPs to incorporate sentiment analysis to further the accuracy of the models.

Currently, it uses LSTMs for generating predictions by using 67000+ datapoints of historical data for training. 

# Before running make sure you have installed the following:
1. Tensorflow: 
```python
pip install tensorflow
```
2. Keras: 
```python
pip install keras
```
3. Numpy: 
```python
pip install numpy
```
4. Robinstocks: 
```python
pip install robinstocks
```

After that, you need a robinhood account in order to train the model for yourself otherwise, you can use the model that has already been trained in the AI dir with "model.h5".
## Note: if you decide to train the model I would advise you to run it on a highend computer as it the training can take upto 10 hours.
Keep in mind that the model currently available is the first iteration and is still under optimization ðŸ˜‰.
